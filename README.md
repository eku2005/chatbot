#  AI Chatbot with PyTorch, NER, and Streamlit

A smart AI-powered chatbot built from scratch using:
- **PyTorch** for custom intent classification
- **spaCy** for Named Entity Recognition (NER)
- **Streamlit** for a clean frontend chat interface
- Supports **multi-turn conversations**, **dynamic entity injection**, and **modular function routing**

---

##  Features

-> Intent classification using a trained PyTorch model  
-> Entity extraction (e.g., `GPE`, `DATE`) using spaCy  
-> Multi-turn conversation with memory of previous entities  
-> Dynamic response templates (`"Hi there from {GPE}"`)  
-> Custom responses via mapped Python functions  
-> Streamlit-based frontend chat UI
