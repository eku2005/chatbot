# 🧠 AI Chatbot with PyTorch, NER, and Streamlit

A smart AI-powered chatbot built from scratch using:
- **PyTorch** for custom intent classification
- **spaCy** for Named Entity Recognition (NER)
- **Streamlit** for a clean frontend chat interface
- Supports **multi-turn conversations**, **dynamic entity injection**, and **modular function routing**

## 🚀 Features

✅ Intent classification using a trained PyTorch model  
✅ Entity extraction (e.g., `GPE`, `DATE`) using spaCy  
✅ Multi-turn conversation with memory of previous entities  
✅ Dynamic response templates (`"Hi there from {GPE}"`)  
✅ Custom responses via mapped Python functions  
✅ Streamlit-based frontend chat UI
